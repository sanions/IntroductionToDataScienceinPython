# IntroductionToDataScienceinPython

This repository contains the programming assignments from Coursera's course "Introduction to Data Science in Python" offered by University of Michigan. The course introuduces the pandas library and using the DataFrame data structure. It also introduces data analysis methods such as boolean mapping and hypothesis testing. 

The project analyzes data about school quality and housing prices to see if there is a significant correlation between the two. Housing data is from Zillow's research site(https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), school location data is from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation(https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/public-schools). The quality measurement used for the correlation function is average SAT score of the high school, but the same analysis could be done with any of the other criteria used to measure quality of high schools.
